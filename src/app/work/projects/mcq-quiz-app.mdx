##Overview

The MCQ Quiz Application is a full-stack web app designed to help users test their knowledge across various topics through multiple-choice quizzes. It offers a seamless experience for learners and admins, featuring real-time scoring, timed quizzes, result tracking, and question management. The app is ideal for students, educators, and training platforms.




## Key Features

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building interactive, component-based front-end with clean UX.
- **NodeJS & Express**: For backend logic, APIs, and secure role-based routing.
- **MongoDB**: To store structured admin and student data, logs, and records.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with consistent design and responsiveness.
- **JWT & Bcrypt**: For secure login, authentication, and role-based access control.
- **Chart.js or Recharts**: For displaying user performance stats.


## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was implementing randomized yet non-repetitive question delivery during each quiz session. This was solved through smart indexing and shuffling algorithms. Ensuring data persistence and result tracking across sessions required structured schema design and local storage fallback. Creating an intuitive admin panel for non-technical users also demanded clean UX and validation logic. User authentication and preventing cheating (e.g., re-attempting with same questions) were addressed via role-based access and attempt history logic.




## Outcome

The MCQ Quiz App has helped learners practice and self-evaluate across various subjects with high engagement. Educators and training providers use it to digitally assess learners’ understanding and track performance over time. The platform is flexible enough to integrate into e-learning systems or use as a standalone testing tool.
