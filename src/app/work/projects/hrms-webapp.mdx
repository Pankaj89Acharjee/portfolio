##Overview

The HRMS application is an end-to-end solution designed to automate and streamline HR operations such as employee onboarding, attendance, leave tracking, payroll, and performance management. It reduces manual workload, centralizes employee data, and enhances organizational efficiency through a role-based access system and intuitive dashboards.




## Key Features


- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and manage employee records, departments, and roles.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Daily in-out logs, manual corrections, and real-time status with geolocation/IP support.
- **Leave Management**: Apply, approve/reject, and track leave balances with automated policies.
- **Payroll System**: Monthly salary generation based on attendance, leave, and performance data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Track goals, self-assessments, and manager feedback in review cycles.
- **Role-Based Access (RBAC)**: Admins, HR, and employees have separate views and privileges.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Email Notifications**: Auto-notify users for approvals, rejections, and reminders.



## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building interactive, component-based front-end with clean UX.
- **NodeJS & Express**: For backend logic, APIs, and secure role-based routing.
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB**: To store structured employee data, logs, and records.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with consistent design and responsiveness.
- **JWT & Bcrypt**: For secure login, authentication, and role-based access control.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline automation.
- **Day.js or Moment.js**: For date and time calculations (attendance, leave, payroll).


## Challenges and Learnings
Handling complex role-based workflows and ensuring smooth data flow between modules was a core challenge. This was resolved through modular API architecture and RBAC middleware. Generating accurate payroll reports based on dynamic attendance and leave data required meticulous validation logic and edge case handling. Also, creating a user-friendly interface for both tech-savvy admins and regular employees demanded iterative prototyping and user testing.


## Outcome

The HRMS system significantly reduced manual HR tasks, improved data accuracy, and enabled real-time visibility into workforce activities. It helped streamline leave approvals, saved time in payroll processing, and centralized employee lifecycle management. Early adopters reported up to 40% reduction in HR operational overhead.
