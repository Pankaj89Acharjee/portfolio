## Overview

AI Mock Interviewer is an intelligent, browser-based platform designed to help candidates practice for technical and behavioral interviews. The system simulates real-time interviews using AI-generated questions, tracks user responses, and provides constructive feedback on communication, confidence, and technical depth. The tool leverages natural language processing (NLP) and is built for scalability and customization across various domains.

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Questions**: Dynamically adapts question sets based on user's role, experience, and topic (e.g., React, NodeJS, DSA).
- **Speech Recognition**: Allows users to speak answers and receive real-time transcription.
- **Performance Analysis**: Provides detailed feedback on speaking pace, filler words, clarity, and completeness.
- **Custom Interview Modes**: Choose from mock HR, technical, or behavioral rounds.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with ReactJS and styled using Tailwind CSS for a smooth experience.
- **Backend APIs**: Developed using NodeJS, with secure and optimized response handling.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployments with GitHub Actions for fast iteration and updates

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Speech Recognition**: Allows users to speak answers and receive real-time transcription.
- **Gemini-AI-Generated Questions**: Dynamically adapts question sets based on user's role, experience, and topic (e.g., React, NodeJS, DSA).
- **Custom Interview Modes**: Choose from mock HR, technical, or behavioral rounds.


## Challenges and Learnings

A primary challenge was integrating real-time speech-to-text processing with accurate and fast feedback generation. This was overcome by using lightweight NLP libraries and streamlined audio handling pipelines. Ensuring question diversity and avoiding repetition across sessions required building a smart question bank system with contextual filtering. Designing an intuitive yet flexible user experience for both technical and non-technical users also demanded iterative prototyping and UI tuning. Deployment was streamlined through GitHub Actions to support continuous updates without downtime.

## Outcome

The AI Mock Interviewer platform helped users boost interview readiness by simulating realistic interview environments, reducing anxiety, and identifying improvement areas. It received positive feedback from early users, particularly job seekers preparing for roles in software development and data science. The tool is scalable, customizable, and has potential for integration into online learning platforms or career coaching products.
