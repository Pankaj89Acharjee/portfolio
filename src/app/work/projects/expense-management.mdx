## Overview

The Expense Management System is a full-stack web application designed to help users track daily expenses, manage budgets, and analyze spending patterns through clean visual dashboards. It provides real-time updates on income vs. expenses and supports category-wise tracking, allowing users to make informed financial decisions.




## Key Features


- **Real-Time Expense Tracking**: Users can add, edit, and delete daily income or expenses with instant updates.
- **Category Management**: Expenses are grouped under customizable categories (e.g., Food, Travel, Utilities).
- **Budget Alerts**: Smart alerts notify users when spending exceeds predefined limits.
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Visual charts display monthly trends, income-expense ratios, and category-wise spending.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with ReactJS and styled using Tailwind CSS for mobile-friendly performance.
- **Secure Authentication**: User accounts are protected using JWT-based login system.
- **Export & Reports**: Generate downloadable reports in PDF/CSV formats for records or audits.


## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the dynamic and modular front-end interface.
- **NodeJS & Express**: To handle backend APIs, user auth, and data operations.
- **MongoDB**: For securely storing user data and transaction records.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For clean, responsive, utility-first styling.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.
- **Chart.js or Recharts**: To visualize data trends and analytics.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation and code deployment workflow.



## Challenges and Learnings
A key challenge was implementing real-time data synchronization across components without page reloads — which was overcome using React hooks and context APIs. Another issue was ensuring secure and fast authentication, addressed by using JWT tokens with proper route protection. Additionally, designing a clean, intuitive UI that presents large financial data in a digestible way required multiple iterations and feedback cycles.


## Outcome

The system empowered users to maintain better control over their finances, with some beta users reporting a 15–20% improvement in monthly savings after consistent usage. It also laid the foundation for integrating future features like recurring transactions, shared wallets, and financial goal tracking.
